<p><em>"Thank you for the work you did with the re-brand and design of our website and online shop. We were very cautious about upgrading our website to an online store however, from the onset, Bright Ideas provided us with a very personable, customer focused service and this has continued throughout the running and further maintenance of our website. The website is proving to be very beneficial and having a mobile enabled shop is proving to be very useful, and also proving to be a key marketing tool to help us compete for new business. Once again, many thanks for your help and support throughout the entire process."</em></p>

<h3>Elm lodge kennels</h3>
<p><em>"My name is Betty warden and I own and run Elm Lodge Boarding Kennels. Andrew Bright was hired to setup my website to enable my business and bookings to reach a wider market. He made an exceptional job of the website and when finished it was of a very high standard. Andrew listened carefully and worked hard to achieve what I requested and as a result of this I am now receiving the majority of my business from the web. I have found him to be very helpful on any queries I have had since then and always quick to advise me on what improvements can be done. I will happily be using Andrew in the near future."<strong><br /></strong></em></p>

Nec vero alia sunt quaerenda contra Carneadeam illam sententiam. Deinde disputat, quod cuiusque generis animantium statui deceat extremum. Facit igitur Lucius noster prudenter, qui audire de summo bono potissimum velit; Quis non odit sordidos, vanos, leves, futtiles?</span></p>
<p><span><span>Negat enim summo bono afferre incrementum diem. Haec mihi videtur delicatior, ut ita dicam, molliorque ratio, quam virtutis vis gravitasque postulat. Haec quo modo conveniant, non sane intellego. Quis enim confidit semper sibi illud stabile et firmum permansurum, quod fragile et caducum sit? Multoque hoc melius nos veriusque quam Stoici. Igitur neque stultorum quisquam beatus neque sapientium non beatus. De hominibus dici non necesse est. Non enim iam stirpis bonum quaeret, sed animalis. Nobis Heracleotes ille Dionysius flagitiose descivisse videtur a Stoicis propter oculorum dolorem. At, illa, ut vobis placet, partem quandam tuetur, reliquam deserit.</span></span></p>]]></bodyText>

  <bodytext><![CDATA[<p>This was the first site I created as a freelance developer having previously worked with one of the clients employees I already had a good rapour established which helped greatly in the planning stages I was given a concept but allowed free creativity on content which was a big plus for me, I built the CSS foundation using a framework then added custom styles on top of this. The project was a big undertaking and produced many challenges as this site was not only built from scratch but also some content migrated from the old site provider and a new requirement was to include an online shop <strong>(eCommerce store)</strong> which integrated with <a href="http://www.worldpay.com/uk">Worldpay</a>. Finally once the site was live a custom content management system <strong>(CMS)</strong> was added so the staff could maintain stock, content and events.</p>
<p>Im proud of this site and that I was able to help the client provide an online store for it's customer base.</p>
<p>About the client <strong>George Polley Motorsport</strong>, also known as Polleysport is a family run business. They have over 35 years experience in the motor sport industry and can offer a wide range of specialist accessories, suspension, wheels and tyres, they are all drivers themselves and have the knowledge and understanding to give you the best possible advice and service.</p>]]></bodytext>

  <title><![CDATA[1 Greenhill Street]]></title>
  <fullDescription><![CDATA[<p><strong>SITUATION</strong> Grade II listed, Loudham Hall is an exceptional Georgian home with a rich architectural history. Located two miles east of Wickham Market (winner of the 2006 Best Village Award in Suffolk), it lies less than seven miles to the north of the picturesque, riverside town of Woodbridge. The main house, gardens and grounds offer privacy yet all the conveniences of a superbly accessible location. Local shopping and recreational facilities can be found in Wickham Market with the county town of Ipswich offering more extensive amenities, as well as a train service to London Liverpool Street (from 72 minutes). <br /> <br /> Good local schools are numerous and include Ipswich School and Prep School, Royal Hospital School and Orwell Park School. There is also Woodbridge School in Woodbridge. <br /> <br /> The land included within the sale provides wonderful walking and riding opportunities. Golf can be enjoyed at Aldeburgh, Woodbridge, Melton and Ipswich and there is excellent sailing on the Alde, Deben and Orwell estuaries and along the east coast. Racing is at Newmarket and Great Yarmouth. The world-class concert hall at Snap Maltings is easily accessible as are the choice of theatres in both Woodbridge and Ipswich.<br /> <br /> The present Loudham Hall was preceded by, and is believed to still contain, a substantial part of an Elizabethan manor house, which is thought to make up the core of the property. The Hall was later substantially altered and improved, in around 1750, when it inherited its Georgian flourishes and perfectly symmetrical front elevation.<br /> <br /> The estate passed from the original Loudham family, by marriage in the early fifteenth century, to a family called Blennerhassett who also had a substantial estate at Diss. Sir Henry Wood who was the Treasurer of the Household of Henrietta, a widow of King Charles I, purchased it in the seventeenth century. His heiress, Mary, was much sought after as a wife and at 16 was contracted to be married to Charles, one of Charles II's sons by Barbara Villiers. The house was remodelled by Charles Wood who inherited following the death of the Duke of Southampton in the mid eighteenth century, although he had probably already been in occupation for some time. <br /><br /><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong> Approached via a long, private driveway, Loudham Hall stands proudly within 100 acres of surrounding parkland, woodland and gardens, enjoying fine views towards the Deben Valley. Listed Grade II*, the Hall has beautifully symmetrical, Flemish bond brick elevations under a tile roof. An exceptional three bay, projecting pediment marks the centre of the front of the house, with four Ionic brick pilasters at first floor level and a domed clock face. A visual feast both inside and out, Loudham offers very well proportioned accommodation for family living and lavish entertaining alike. <br /><br /><strong>GROUND</strong> <strong>FLOOR</strong> Favourably reviewed by the architectural historian Sir Nikolaus Pevsner, Loudham Hall has copious fine internal features that include the magnificent wood panelled Entrance Hall with a lavish pair of Corinthian columns and original flagstone flooring. It creates an instantly impressive welcome and connects with the central Staircase Hall and Side Entrance Hall, both of which join and cross the length of the house from east to west. This makes for a very logical layout, with all the principal reception rooms positioned off these splendid central corridors. Extravagant fireplaces - invariably with marble surrounds - are regular features inside Loudham Hall and are of particular note in the Dining Room and Drawing Room: the latter has a Neo Classical marble chimney piece with fluted pilasters supporting a carved central panel holding a reclining beauty in a classical landscape.<br /> <br /> The Kitchen/Breakfast Room has been well designed and adapted for modern life with a four door Aga and a striking copper chimney above it. There is a useful Pantry and Utility Room to either side. <br /> <br /> For more details, please consult the floorplans. </p>]]></fullDescription>
